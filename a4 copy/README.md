Required: First, delete these notes, and include YOUR OWN, before pushing
to your remote repo. This file *must* use Markdown syntax, and provide project
documentation--otherwise, points *will* be deducted.

Also, global subdir. is missing header.php and footer.php. You'll need to create
your own files!  :)
